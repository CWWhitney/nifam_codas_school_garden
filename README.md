Decision model for a school garden nutrition intervention in urban Hanoi. There are three simulated options: 
1. A school garden on existing school property, as an informal addition to the school and passively used for education, 
2. the same garden as a formal part of the STEM education program, actively used for education, with incurred training and other costs but also offsetting education and extracurricular costs,
3. maintain the existing uses of the space that would otherwise be used for the garden, play space etc. 

Working backward in complexity these three models describe the impact of the school garden intervention 1. as a decision for school boards, 2. for food environment outcomes and 3. interventions to the food environment.
