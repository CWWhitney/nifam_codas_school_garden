Decision model for a school garden nutrition intervention in urban Hanoi. There are three simulated options: 1. A school garden on existing school property, as an informal addition to the school and passively used for education, 2. the same garden as a formal part of the STEM education program, actively used for education, with incurred training and other costs but also offsetting education and extracurricular costs.
